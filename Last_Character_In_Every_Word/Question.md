## Problem Statement

Write a Java program to print the last character of every word in a given string

### Conditions

Ignore all the digits and whitespaces

## Input

    Hey3 Java   Learners

## Output

    as

## Explanation

> As the first word `Hey3` has digit in its last position, ignore it.
> The second word `Java` has multiple white spaces after it. But those white spaces should be ignored and only the last character should be printed.
> Likewise, the last character of the word `Learners` should be printed.
> Thus, the output `as`.
