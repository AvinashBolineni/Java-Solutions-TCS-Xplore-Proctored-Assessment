### Can I use it?

Ya, you can very well use it. But I don't think this will be useful for you, as its specifically designed for the project structure we maintain. If you really wish, you can always make use of this and tweak it to your needs.

---

### How to?

- Open up your terminal and run `git clone --single-branch https://github.com/venkivijay/Java-Solutions-TCS-Xplore-Proctored-Assessment.git` (I maintain the website files in `website` branch, so you don't need to clone everything if you need only the website files)
- Run `cd Java-Solutions-TCS-Xplore-Proctored-Assessment/` (Sorry, for the long name)
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run serve` to spin up the local dev server

---

### Things to note

- Change the `publicPath` in `vue.config.js` file as necessary
